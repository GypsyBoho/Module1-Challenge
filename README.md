## Description

[Visit the Horiseon Deployed Site](https://gypsyboho.github.io/Module1-Challenge/)

- This page provides an accessible landing page website for the Horiseon marketing company.
- I built this landing page website for the marketing company Horiseon so that they would have a presense on the web and they could help customers with their SEO optimization.
- It is meant for anyone who might need help with their website SEO. 
- This landingpage has helped Horiseon have a face and somewhere to connect clients if they want more information.
- I learned that div classes are better written as specific semantics such as "article" and "section" and that alt text is important for screen readers and how to condense repetitive code.
