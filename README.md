# Module1-Challenge

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- This page provides an accessible landing page website for the marketing company
- Why did you build this project? I built this landing page website for the marketing company Horiseon so that they would have a presense on the web and they could help customers with their SEO optimization.
- This landingpage has helped Horiseon have a face and somewhere to connect clients if they want more information.
- I learned that div classes are better written as specific semantics such as "article" and "section" and that alt text is important for screen readers and how to condense repetitive code.
